## How to Setup Project Locally

1. Clone this project by running `git clone git@github.com:Varsilias/aptiw-task-frontend.git`
2. If successful, you need to navigate into the project folder by running the command `cd aptiw-task-frontend`
3. Run the command `cp .env.example .env` to create environment variables. You can also create a **.env** file manually in case the `cp` command does not work on your PC. Remember to add the neccessary field. See the **.env.example** file for reference
4. Install project dependencies by running the command `yarn or npm install`
5. Start the development server by running the command `yarn dev or npm run dev`
